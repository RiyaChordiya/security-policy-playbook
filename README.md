# Security Policy & Incident Response Playbook

This project demonstrates my ability to create and manage foundational cybersecurity documentation aligned with real-world standards such as NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls. It includes:

- Core organizational security policies
- Four detailed incident response (IR) playbooks
- Real-world incident scenarios
- Visual IR process flowchart
- Structured in a way that's usable in GRC, InfoSec, or audit settings
