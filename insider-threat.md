# Incident Response Playbook: Insider Threat

## 1. Description
An insider threat involves an internal actor (employee, contractor, vendor) misusing their access intentionally or accidentally.

## 2. Detection
- Unusual data access patterns (downloads, after-hours activity)
- Alerts from DLP tools or SIEM
- Reports from coworkers or managers

## 3. Containment
- Restrict or suspend user access
- Collect forensic evidence (logs, emails, file activity)
- Involve HR/legal immediately

## 4. Eradication
- Remove unauthorized access or rogue accounts
- Revoke exposed credentials or API tokens
- Restore affected data or permissions

## 5. Recovery
- Reinstate services only if cleared by legal and security
- Conduct structured debrief with involved departments

## 6. Lessons Learned
- Improve insider threat monitoring (UEBA, DLP)
- Train staff on reporting suspicious behavior
- Evaluate background checks and onboarding controls
